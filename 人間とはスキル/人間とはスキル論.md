I think human beings are set of skills. What I want to say is you can take any skills by to effor for the skill, e.g you can pass the  examination of tokyo university, become champion at tennis or take some big title.
Any human have skill tree which is able to grow up, but it can't grow same as other humans. As you can see, humans are in diversity, e.g tall, weight, and brain.
So you guys don't think that you pass the examination of tokyo university or become champion on tennis I think the reason of it is you don't know the existing of "meta skill tree". 
"meta skill " have been talked in several columns, but any columns are not talking about true "meta skill".
I think true meta skill is the skills to grow the skills.
For example, the problem what to do for pass the examination of tokyo university. To study hard is answer for pass the exam generally. Is it collect? I don't think so.
Grow the skill for pass the exam of tokyo daigaku is what you need to do.
What can grow the skill for pass the exam of tokyo daigaku is , study, device of study ... etc. But general person couldn't it because not have skill to focus to them(It's apply to me). So you think how get skill to focus for study to grow the skill to pass the exam of tokyo daigaku. This thinking skill is true "meta skill" I think.
